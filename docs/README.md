The main features of this app include:

- View notes – Easily view your saved notes without worrying about losing them or encountering unexpected issues.

- Edit notes – You can modify both the title and the content of your notes as you like, with no limitations.

- You can also delete notes, search for notes, or even leave the content blank when viewing a note.


Other features:

- Theme switching – Easily switch between light, dark, or system default themes from the settings menu.

- Multilingual support – Choose your preferred language from the settings.

- Related information – You can check out our project on GitHub, contribute translations, or report bugs to help reduce our workload and improve user support.
